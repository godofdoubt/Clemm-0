 This is a basic **cybernetic framework** that utilizes the **llama-cpp-python** module with **CUDA** support to run a spaceship-themed roleplay. It uses a custom **agentic AI crew** framework, written in pure Python without a pre-built library. The application will offer both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (UI Matrix Theme) built with **Tkinter**. It also includes basic functionality to open, close, and prepare files for a **GGUF model**.

### **`.env` File and Paths**

You haven't provided the contents of your `.env` file or the specific tool paths, but I can give you a template for what they should look like.

A correct `.env` file should contain key-value pairs for sensitive information or configurable settings. For your project, this might include:

```env
# Path to your GGUF model file
MODEL_PATH = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\model\\file.gguf"

# Or for a non-Windows path
# MODEL_PATH = "/path/to/your/model/file.gguf"

# Other potential variables
# LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
# API_KEY = "your_api_key_if_needed"
```

The tool paths would be defined within your Python scripts (like `tools.py`), and they would reference these `.env` variables using a library like `python-dotenv`.

### **Installation and Setup**

The commands you provided are a good starting point for a Windows setup, but there's a potential compatibility issue and some small improvements for clarity.

Here's a refined version of the installation steps:

1.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    py -3.12 -m venv .rvn
    .rvn\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
2.  **Upgrade `pip` and Core Packages**
    ```bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```
3.  **Install Python Libraries**
    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv pydantic requests
    ```
4.  **Install `llama-cpp-python` with CUDA**
    ```bash
    pip install llama-cpp-python --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu125 --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir
    ```
5.  **Install PyTorch with CUDA**
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    ```
6.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python warp-core.py
    ```

**Important Note:** The CUDA version for `llama-cpp-python` (`cu125`) and PyTorch (`cu128`) are different. While this might work, it's generally best practice to ensure your CUDA dependencies are aligned to avoid unexpected issues. Check if there is a `llama-cpp-python` wheel available for `cu128` to maintain consistency.
